Repository for the Web Developer task #1 for my internship at Prodigy Infotech: A site with an interactive menu.

This website features three sample pages: Home, About, and Services. Each one of them is structured the same, with the website header at the top, a large subheading section, and body text at the bottom.

By default, the header is blue, and the text color of the menu is white. Once the user scrolls past the subheading section, the header's colors are inverted, with the menu options having a blue text color and the navigation being white.

Furthermore, if one hovers their mouse on a menu item, an underline will smoothly appear below the word, from left to right.
